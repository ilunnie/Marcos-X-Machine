> **A Roguelike Bullet Hell inspired by _Enter the Gungeon_, built entirely from scratch.**

## About the Project

**Marcos X Machine** is a 2D action game developed by a team of **4 students** during a technical competition.

The core challenge of this project was to create a fully functional game **without using any game engines** (like Unity, Godot, or Unreal). Every mechanic, from the rendering loop to the collision system, was written in **pure C#** utilizing the **Windows Forms** framework.

Drawing heavy inspiration from genre classics like *Enter the Gungeon*, the game features fast-paced combat, dungeon exploration, and bullet-hell mechanics.

## Key Features

* **Engine-Free Development:** A custom game loop and rendering engine built strictly on top of Windows Forms (GDI+).
* **Bullet Hell Combat:** Intense patterns and high-density projectile management.
* **Advanced AI:** Enemies utilize the **A* (A-Star) pathfinding algorithm** to navigate the map and track the player dynamically.
* **Original Assets:** Custom-made character art and visual assets.

## Tech Stack

* **Language:** C# (.NET)
* **GUI/Rendering:** Windows Forms
* **Architecture:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## The Team

This project was a collaborative effort by 4 students:

* **Luís Gustavo** – *Lead Programmer & Architect. Responsible for the project's core structure, code organization, and main C# logic.*
* **Luiz Antonio Rosa Cardoso** – *Gameplay Programmer & Character Artist. Responsible for the Entity System implementation, Enemy AI (AStar Pathfinding), and character asset creation.*
* **Marcos Henrique** – *Gameplay Programmer & Environment Artist. Developed the map rendering system and boss fight mechanics; hand-drew all environment tilesets.*
* **Eric Coutinho** – *Audio Engineer & Technical Artist. Programmed the audio system, produced all sound effects/assets, and assisted with tileset design.*
